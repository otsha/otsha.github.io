# About me
Hi! 

I'm Otso, a developer, a creative and a full-time Helsinkian. This site is dedicated to showcasing some of my creative work, which includes photography, 3d art, UX and visual design.

If you'd like to see up-to-date examples of my code, you may want to check out the pinned repositories [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/otsha).
