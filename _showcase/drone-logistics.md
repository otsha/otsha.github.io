Delivery by drone is (at least a part of) the future of postal services.

Online shopping is not going away, and postal centers handle massive amounts of deliveries daily. Workers at these delivery centers and warehouses need a quick and painless solution to simply pick up a shipment and send it off.

The concept presents a simple and efficient application that facilitates sending out drone deliveries. It is aimed to be a lightweight application used in conjunction with more robust inventory and drone traffic control systems.

To send a delivery following this concept, the user:
- Scans a code identifying the package
- Scans a code identifying a flight-ready drone
- Attaches the package to the drone
- Confirms that the delivery is ready to be sent off
