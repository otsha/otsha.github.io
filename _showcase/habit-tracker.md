# Habit Tracker

*The (outdated and likely non-functional) code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/otsha/habit-tracker)*

The application's purpose is to allow users to track their daily habits and view basic statistics regarding their progress.

It was created during an university course where the goal was to build a fullstack web application. Technologies used included React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB, with SemanticUI serving as the UI library.
