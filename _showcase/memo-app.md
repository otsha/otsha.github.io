# Memo App

Sometimes you need to take notes on several things going on at the same time. For example, during a lecture, you may want to separate your reading list notes and your actual lecture notes to keep things from getting cluttered! Or maybe you'd like to refer to the previous lecture's notes to connect the information you've just learned.

Ever looked at a project management tool, such as GitHub Projects or Trello, and thought that the way the "boards" are presented could also be very useful for taking notes? Enter this design of a note-taking app. You can open, close, create and save boards on the fly, all while maintaining a clean and collected side-by-side overview of everything.
